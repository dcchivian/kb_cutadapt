parameters :
    input_reads :
        ui-name : Input Reads or ReadsSet
        short-hint : The reads library (or reads set) to process

    output_object_name :
        ui-name : Output Reads
        short-hint : Name for the output read library (or reads set)

    adapter_sequence_5P:
        ui-name: Sequence
        short-hint: The Adapter sequence to match; wildcards can be marked by 'N'
    anchored_5P:
        ui-name: Anchored
        short-hint: Anchor the match to the 5 end of each read

    adapter_sequence_3P:
        ui-name: Sequence
        short-hint: The Adapter sequence to match; wildcards can be marked by 'N'
    anchored_3P:
        ui-name: Anchored
        short-hint: Anchor the match to the 3 end of each read

    error_tolerance:
        ui-name: Error Tolerance (Max Error Rate)

        ui-name: Min Overlap Length
        short-hint: Minimum length required to consider a match

    min_read_length:
        ui-name: Min Read Length
        short-hint: Minimum length of cut read to retain in output library

    discard_untrimmed:
        ui-name: Discard Untrimmed
        short-hint: Keep or discard reads that don't have a matching adapter
